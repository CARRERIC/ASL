### Transformation of the YOLOv7 Model
The transformation of the YOLOv7 model includes a series of technical and methodological innovations that optimize its performance in complex object detection tasks. These improvements cover the model's architecture, training processes, and the management of labels and input data. Specifically, YOLOv7 implements advanced label assignment and gradient propagation strategies, overcoming previous limitations and delivering superior performance across various applications.
YOLOv7 Workflow Steps
Step 1: Data Initialization and Preparation
data = load_and_preprocess_data()
data = augment_data(data)
Step 2: Model Architecture Definition
model = YOLOv7()
model.define_architecture()
Step 3: Label Assignment
labels = guided_label_assignment(data)
Step 4: Model Training
optimizer = configure_optimizer()
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in data_batches:
        predictions = model(batch['images'])
        loss = compute_loss(predictions, batch['labels'])
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
Step 5: Evaluation and Validation
validation_metrics = evaluate_model(model, validation_data)
print("Validation Metrics:", validation_metrics)
Step 6: Optimization and Fine-Tuning
model = optimize_model(model)
Step 7: Deployment
deploy_model(model, deployment_environment)

YOLOv7 Algorithm Pseudocode
1. Model Initialization and Loading Pre-trained Weights
model = load_yolov7_model(weights_path)
2. Input Image Preprocessing
def preprocess_image(image):
    # Resize the image to the model's required input (e.g., 640x640)
    resized_image = resize(image, target_size=(640, 640))
    # Normalize pixel values to a range of [0, 1]
    normalized_image = normalize(resized_image)
    return normalized_image
3. Model Inference
def infer(model, preprocessed_image):
    # Perform model inference
    output = model.predict(preprocessed_image)
    return output
4. Post-processing Detections
def postprocess_output(output, confidence_threshold, nms_threshold):
    # Filter detections by confidence threshold
    detections = filter_by_confidence(output, threshold=confidence_threshold)
    # Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove duplicates
    final_detections = non_maximum_suppression(detections, threshold=nms_threshold)
    return final_detections
5. Object Detection Function
def detect_objects(image, model, confidence_threshold=0.5, nms_threshold=0.4):
    # Preprocess the image
    preprocessed_image = preprocess_image(image)
    # Perform inference
    output = infer(model, preprocessed_image)
    # Post-process detections
    detections = postprocess_output(output, confidence_threshold, nms_threshold)
    return detections

Training Command
To train the model, all preparations were completed, and the following command was executed:
python train.py --workers 1 --device 0 --batch-size 4 --epochs 4000 \
--data data/custom.yaml --img 640 640 --cfg cfg/training/yolov7.yaml \
--weights runs/train/yolov7-custom5/last.pt --resume 'yolov7.pt' \
--hyp data/hyp.scratch.custom.yaml

Image Cache Files
During training, two image cache files are created. These files store detailed data for each image, such as X and Y coordinates, dimensions (width and height), and depth. This enables faster access to image information, reducing data retrieval time and improving model performance. Additionally, these cache files are useful for repeating the training if necessary.
