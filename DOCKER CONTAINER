The Docker container image was created and initialized, necessary for execution. The following command was used:

```bash
sudo docker run --name yolov7_res -it -v $PWD:/yolov7 --shm-size=64g nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.08-py3
```

Where:

- **`docker run`**: Command used to create and run a new container from a Docker image.
- **`--name yolov7_res`**: Assigns a name to the container, in this case, `yolov7_res`, which simplifies identification and management.
- **`-it`**: This combination has two purposes:
  - **`-i` (interactive)**: Keeps the standard input open even if there is no connection.
  - **`-t` (pseudo-TTY)**: Allocates a pseudo-TTY terminal, allowing interaction with the container as if it were a physical terminal.
- **`-v $PWD:/yolov7`**: This flag mounts a volume, meaning a directory from the host machine is mounted inside the container:
  - **`$PWD`**: An environment variable representing the current directory on the host machine.
  - **`/yolov7`**: The mount point inside the container, allowing the content of the current directory on the host machine to be accessible within the container under the `/yolov7` directory.
- **`--shm-size=64g`**: Adjusts the shared memory size for the container, allocating 64 gigabytes of shared memory. This is useful for applications requiring large amounts of memory, such as certain deep learning models.
- **`nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.08-py3`**: The Docker image used to create the container.

Within the container, the necessary dependencies for proper functioning were installed by executing the following commands:

```bash
apt update
apt install -y zip htop screen libgl1-mesa-glx
pip install seaborn thop
```
