### Image Structure

The images labeled with **labelImg** follow a specific folder structure located in the `train_alabe` folder within the root directory of the **yolov7** repository. The structure is as follows:

- **`train/images`**: Folder containing the training images.
- **`train/labels`**: Folder containing `.txt` files with labels corresponding to the training images.
- **`valid/images`**: Folder containing the validation images.
- **`valid/labels`**: Folder containing `.txt` files with labels corresponding to the validation images.

The image directory was added to the `data` folder, where a YAML file (`custom.yaml`) was created containing the paths to the images. The file is structured as follows:

```yaml
# Location of the images
# path: ../train_alabe # dataset root dir
train: /yolov7/train_alabe/train/images
val: /yolov7/train_alabe/valid/images
test: # test images (optional)

# Classes used
nc: 7 # number of classes
names: [’Erosion’, ’Grieta_concha’, ’Grieta_coat’, ’GuardaPolvo’, 
        ’Impacto_Rayo’, ’Mal_acabado’, ’Suciedad’] # Class names
```

Subsequently, the **`yolov7.yaml`** file located in `cfg/training` was modified to configure the number of classes (`nc: 7`). Additionally, the pre-trained weights for the YOLOv7 model were downloaded and saved in the root folder of the **yolov7** directory.
